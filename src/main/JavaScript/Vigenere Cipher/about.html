  <center><u>Vigenere Cipher</u></center>
</h1>
<p>
  It is very similar to Caesar cryptosystem but we use several keys instead of
  just a single key
</p>

<p>
  <i
    >"Vigenere cryptosystem is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a
    series of interwoven Caesar ciphers based on the letter of a keyword"</i
  >
  <ul>
      <li>it is a form of polyalphabetic substitution method</li>
      <li>very easy to understand and to implement</li>
      <li>it was constructed in the 16th century and it was thought to be unbreakable the indecipherable cipher</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>What is the problem with Caesar Cipher? </h4>
  <p>That there are so few possible key values(26 possible values) ~ so the keyspace is rather small</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Vigenere cipher uses a given word as the private key</li>
      <li>the numerical representations of the letters in the key define how many characters to shift the actual letter in the plaintext</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Key: S->18,E->4 ,C->2,->R-17,E->4,T->19</p>
  instead of using a single value as the key(<b>Caesar cipher<b>) we have as many values as the number of letters in the private key 
</p>
<p>SIZE OF THE KEYSPACE=26<sup>SIZE OF THE KEY</sup></p>
