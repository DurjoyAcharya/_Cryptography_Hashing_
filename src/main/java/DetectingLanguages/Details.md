**==========Detecting Languages==========**
<br>
When cracking a given cipher it maybe useful to detect whether the decrypted
language is english or not
1. We can use a dictionary and check if the given words are present in a dictionary or not<br>
   ðŸ‘‰ these dictionaries(containing most of the english words)
   are available on the web
2. We can use machine learning techiques to detect language<br>
   ðŸ‘‰ working fine but we need a huge training dataset with english sentences<br>
   ðŸ‘‰ Then the algorithm, whether it's K nearest neighbor,
   classifier support,vector machines or deep neural networks,logistic regression these algorithms are going to
   analyze these sentences and they are able to detect whether a new sentences is in English or not
